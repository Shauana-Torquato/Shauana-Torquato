- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Shauana-Torquato

- In the moment I'm reorganising and restructuring my GitHub account, I'm cleaning it, unifying the contributions I did in an old account of mine, uploading projects and materials I was unsure and insecure about while studying (due to errors), uploading my new personal projects and ideas.
- Till day 31 of January - 2025, I have 4 main projects I want to organize and upload with excelence - each one using a different language so 1 in Java, 1 in Python, 1 in C++ and 1 in C#
- And the reason for these 4 main languages is because I want to explore the Computational Logic in a way that I can feel comfortable and more flexible about learning new languages an technologies
- My GitHub doesn't have much to offer right now, since I also deleted a lot of stuff I was not liking anymore, this introdction itself will be changed soon, so in January there will be a better structured here and better portfolio component - I remind here that initially this was for my personal studies and "error-correct attempts" kind of account.

- I have good skills in English and I'm learning German, I'm concluding the Software Engineering course and I already have the System Analysis and Development Technologian studies, now I'm in the process of building practical experience
